#' A function to multiply two numbers

#' @description 
#' This function will multiply the input values of X and Y
#' 
#' @param x one number you'd like to multiply
#' y the other number you'd like to multiply
fun <- function(x, y) {
  ans <- x * y
  return(ans)
}

# Let's make a util .R file and put this function in there
# clear environment and load functions -- shows up as something you can just run now
# Note that the documentation is present in the little "note" icon link.
